        }
    },
```

#5. For AWS Lambda Functions (to perform actuation)
- Function 1: Sets desired state for device (actuation). e.g. tells device from the cloud to unlock door. 
  - File: g49_ActuateDoor.py
- Extract:
```
    payload = {
        "state": {
            desired_or_reported.lower(): {
                "doorLocation": doorLocation2,
                attribute2: value2,   //Example: attribute 2=lockStatus, value 2=lock
                "timestamp": timestamp2
            }
        }
    }
```

- Function 2: Sets desired state for device (actuation). e.g. tells device from the cloud to display alert on Command Center LCD. 
  - File: g49_ActuateLCD.py
- Extract:
```
      payload = {
        "state": {
            desired_or_reported.lower(): {
                attribute2: value2,  //Example: attribute2=StudentsIDInArea, value2=9712, 4958
                "timestamp": timestamp2
            }
        }
    }
```

  - will be updated based on g49pi sensor data
	
-4. g49_alert_authorised_beacon (Rule)
  - Monitors g49Door1 (Thing) and sends a message that beacon is authorised to open door via a AWS IoT Republish Action to g49Trace (Thing) $$aws/things/g49Trace/shadow/update.

  - Change in application state used to trigger AWS IoT rules. i.e. perform Actuations.  
  - g49_NoFireActuateDoor(Rule), g49_FireActuateDoorLCD and g49_record_door1_data (Rule) will monitor this Thing to triggers Rules Actions. 

-9. g49_NoFireActuateDoor(Rule)
  - Monitors g49Trace (Thing) and triggers a Lamda Action (Function name: g49_ActuateDoor) that will sent the desired state for the Raspberry Pi to perform an actuate function. i.e. open the electromagnetic door for the authorised handicap student.
  - Query Statement: SELECT 'g49pi' as device, state.reported.location as doorLocation, 'lockStatus' as attribute, 'unlock' as value, 'desired' as desired_or_reported FROM '$aws/things/g49Trace/shadow/update/accepted' WHERE state.reported.authorised = true AND state.reported.fire = 'no'
 
-10. g49_FireActuateDoorLCD(Rule)
  - Monitors g49Trace (Thing) and triggers a Lamda Action (Function name: g49_ActuateLCD) that will sent the desired state for the Raspberry Pi to perform an actuate function. i.e. open the electromagnetic door during internal or external fire, send ID of handicap students who are still in the area during the fire to command center LCD to activate help.
  - Query Statement: SELECT 'g49pi' as device, 'studentIDsInArea' as attribute, state.reported.studentIDsInArea as value, 'desired' as desired_or_reported FROM '$aws/things/g49Trace/shadow/update/accepted' WHERE state.reported.fire = 'yes'
  
-11. g49_record_door1_data (Rule)
  - Monitors g49Trace (Thing) and trigger two Actions
	  - DynamoDB Rule Action (insert into DynamoDB): To write all sensor data updates into a sensor data table to record the sensor data that can be use by our applications.
	  - Lambda Rule Action (Function name: IndexSensorData) for Sumo logic: To write the sensor data into the Sumo Logic search engine to allow us to scan for the data by pattern, and to also generate charts and dashboard to help us understand the data better.
  - Query Statement: SELECT *, version, topic() as topic, traceId() as traceId FROM '$aws/things/g49Trace/shadow/update/accepted'
